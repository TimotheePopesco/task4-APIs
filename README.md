# task4-APIs

I initialized the project and started by choosing the Apis I wanted to use. I then turned to beer, which is very famous in Ireland, and cooking recipes to keep with the food and drink theme. 

Then, I started by indenting the project correctly I converted the json to dart via : https://javiercbk.github.io/json_to_dart/ which I put in the corresponding models. then to each model I created a view . There was also a screen to navigate to the different apis. I tried to create a condition because some data had no images. I tried to modify the image and replace it if equal to null in the model but without success. I styled the whole thing as a div with orange to remind me of beer ale, brown to remind me of beer stouts and purple for the aesthetics of my recipes.
